    <string name="welcome_screen_text">"Friendly is a WIP project that—i hope—will be finished as soon as it posssible. Making some long welcome text to this look a little bit complete.\n\nFor now we only support only sign up feature for testing purposes. That means that currently after sign up you won't be able to sign in to your account when you reset this app or try launching it on another device.\n                "</string>
